# Choosing a Text Editor

#### Terms to keep in mind when choosing:
1. Code completion: displays possible suggesstions dependong on what you've typed
1. Syntax highlighting: colorizing the text you type to differentiate between different pieces of code
1. Variety of themes: allows you to change color of the background and text to alleviate eye strain and fatigue
1. Ability to choose from many extensions when needed: extensions are like plugins, and allows you to add functionality as you need it

## Difference between Text Editors and IDEs
Text Editor: edit text, manage text, and manage files. 

IDE (Integrated Development Environment): a text editor, a file manager, a compiler, and a debugger all in one package.



## Basical Terminal Usage Notes
Basics: Line 1 is prompt. After you enter a command, it will then run the command and output. Once it's finished, will present the prompt again. 

Current location: ls (short for list). 

At the top of the file structure is the root directory, denoted by a single slash (/).

Absolute path: specify a location (file or directory) in relation to the root directory. They begin with a forward slash (/)

Relative path: specify a location (file or directory) in relation to where we currently are in the system. They will not begin with a slash.

Shortcuts:
- (~) is a shortcut for home directory
- . (.dot) is reference for current directory
- .. (dotdot) is a reference to the parent directory

Change directory: use the cd command

Keep in mind: case sensitive, no spaces in names, anything inside quotes is considered a single item
