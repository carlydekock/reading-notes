# How Computers Work - Top Takeaways

## What Makes a Computer?
- Ability to take in information, store info as data, process it, and then output results.

## Binary & Data
- The binary number system: only two digits - 0 and 1
- Where the decimal system multiplies by ten, 1s/10s/100s... the binary system multiples by 2, 1s/2s/4s/8s...
- Any number can be represented by 1s or 0s, or by wires representing on or off
- Text, images and sound can also be represented with numbers
- Text in binary - can assign a number to each letter, and therefore represent words or paragraphs by sequences of numbers
- Images in binary - each pixel has a color, and each color can be represented with numbers
- Sound in binary - every sound is a series of vibrations, which can be represented graphically by a waveform, which can be represented by a number

## Circuits & Logic
- Every input or output is effectively a type of info, which can be represented by on or off electrical signals (1s or 0s)
- Computers modify and combine the input signals
- Circuits act as logic gates, many small circuits that perform simple logical calculations, connecting them together allows for more complex calculations

## CPU, Memory, Input & Output
- Memory stores information
- CPU (central processing unit) where all calculations are done
- An example:
  - Input- press a key on keyboard
  - Keyboard converts letter to a number
  - Sent in binary into the computer
  - CPU calcuates how to display letter b
  - CPU requests instructions from memory of how to draw the letter b
  - CPU runs instructions and stores results as pixels in memory
  - Pixel info is sent in binary to the screen
  - Screen is output device, converts binary to the tiny lights and colors that you see
- Output devices can control audio and motion
- Modern computers often have multiple CPUs to process information

## Hardware and Software
- Hardware: circuits, chips, wires, speakers, plugs, and other physical stuff inside a computer
- Software: all the computer programs or code running on the machine, tells the CPU what to do
- CPU: master chip that controls all the other parts of the computer
- Real magic of the CPU is how it knows which circuits to use and how to use them
- Operating system: the master program that manages how software uses the hardware of a computer
