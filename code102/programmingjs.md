# Programming with JavaScript

## Intro + Scripts:
- How JavaScript makes web pages more interactive:
  1. Access content: Use JS to select any element, attribute or text from an HTML page
  1. Modify content: Use JS to add elements, attributes, and text to the page, or remove them
  1. Program rules: You can specify a set of steps for the browser to follow, which allows it to access or change the content of a page
  1. React to events: You can specify that a specific script should run when a specific event has occured.
- What is a script and how do you create one?
  - Script is a series of instructions, such as a recipe, a handbook or user manual
  - Writing a script: First state your goal, then list the tasks that need to be completed in order to achieve it
    - Define the goal
    - Design the script: identify tasks and steps
    - Code each step

## Expressions and Operators
- An **expression** evaluates into (results in) a single value. There are two types:
  1. Expressions that just assign a value to a variable.
  1. Expressions that use two or more values to return a single variable.
- Expressions rely on **operators**, which allow programmers to create a single value from one or more values.
- Types of operators:
  - Assignment operators: assign a value to a variable
  - Arithmetic operators: perform basic math (+,-,/,*,++,--,%)
  - String operators: combine two strings (just one string operator: +)
    - Process of joining two or more strings is called **concatenation**
  - Comparison operators: compare two values and return true or false
  - Logical operators: combine expressions and return true or false

## Functions
- Functions let you group a series of statements together to perform a specific task
- Pieces of information passed to a function are known as **parameters**
- The answer or response a function provides you is the **return value**
- Anonymous functions do not have names, and therefore cannot be called. They are exected as soon as the interpreter comes across them. 
- Declaring a function:
  1. Give it a name
  1. Write the statements needed to achieve its task inside curly braces
- Calling a function: once the function has been declared, you can then execute all of the statements between its curly braces with just one line of code
- Declaring functions that need information: when you declare the function you give it parameters. Inside the function the parameters act like variables.
  - If a function needs information to work, you indicate what it needs to know in paratheses after the function name.
  - When you design a script, you need to note the information the function will require in order to perform its task.
  - When you call a function that has parameters, you specify the values it should use in the parenthesis that follow its name. These values are called arguments, and they can be values or variables.
