# Growth Mindset

## What is a *growth mindset*? 
Growth mindset is a dedication to learning, belief in myself that I can continue to learn and develop through perserverance and effort. You can read a bit more about it [here](https://www.atlassian.com/blog/inside-atlassian/growth-mindset). 

Atlassian defines the growth mindset as:
> A growth mindset believes that one's fundamental abilities can be developed through perseverance and effort; intelligence and talent are simply good starting points. A growth mindset is synonymous with a love of learning.

## Reminders to myself of how to keep in a growth mindset:
1. Remember to ask for help, it's ok to not know the answer right away.
1. Failing is a **fundamental** part of learning, do not get discouraged. Lean into trying something new and potential failure, you'll learn more! Stay positive and believe in yourself that you will figure it out. 
1. If you get stuck, get up and take a few minutes away from the problem. Come back to it refreshed and with a fresh perspective.
