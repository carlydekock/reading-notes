# Operators and Loops

## Comparison Operators: Evaluating Conditions
- Can evaluate a situation by comparing one value in the script to what you expect it might be, which will result in a Boolean: true or false.
- Different operators:
  - `==` is equal to
  - `===` strict equal to
  - `!=` is not equal to
  - `!==` strict not equal to
  - `>` greater than
  - `<` less than
  - `>=` greater than or equal to
  - `<=` less than or equal to

## Logical Operators
- Allow you to compare the reslts of more than one comparison operator.
- Types of operators:
  - `&&` logical and, tests more than one condition
  - `||` logical or, tests at least one condition
  - `!` logical not, takes a single Boolean value and inverts it

## Loops/Looping
- Loops check a condition, if it returns true a code block will run. The condition will be checked again, and will continue until the condition returns false.
- Types of loops:
  1. For: if you need to run code a specific number of times
  1. While: if you don't know how may times the code should run
  1. Do While: similar to the while loop, but will always run the statements inside the curly braces at least once even if the condition evaluates to false

## For Loop
- Uses a counter as a condition
- Condition made up of three statements:
  1. Initialization: create a variable (i or j) and set it to 0, this acts as the counter
  1. Condition: loop should continue until the counter reaches a specific number
  1. Update: every time the loop has run the statements in the curly braces it adds one to the counter (i++)

## While Loop
- Loop will continue to run as long as the condition (i < 10 for example) set in the parenthesis is true
