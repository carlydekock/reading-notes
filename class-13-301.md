## Sending Form Data
- HTML form on a web page is nothing more than a convenient user-friendly way to configure an HTTP request to send data to a server
- This enables the user to provide information to be delivered in the HTTP request
- The form element defines how the data will be sent, all of its attributes are designed to let you configure the request to be sent when a user hits a submit button
- Two most important attributes are action and method
- Action attribute: defines where data gets sent, value must be valid relative or absolute URL
- Method attribute: defines how the data is sent, most common methods are GET and POST

### GET Method
- Method used by browser to ask the server to send back a given resource
- If a form is sent using this method the data sent to the server is appended to the URL
- Data is appended in a series of name/value pairs
- After the URL web address has ended, ? follwed by name/value pairs (each name/value is separated by  &)

### POST Method
- Method the browser uses to talk to the server when asking for a response that takes into account the data provided in the body of the HTTP request
- When form is submitted using POST method, no data is appended to the URL
- Data is included in the request body instead

### Server side - retrieving the data
- Server receives a string that will be parsed in order to get the data as a list of key/value pairs
- Way you access the list depends on the development platform you use and on any specific frameworks you may be using with it

### Sending Files
- Enctype attribute: lets you specify the value of the Content-Type HTTP header included in the request generated when the form is submitted
- Header is important because it tells the server what kind of data is being sent
- By default, the value of enctype is application/x-www-form-urlencoded
- If you want to send files:
  - set the method attribute to POST because file content can't be put inside URL parameters
  - set the value of enctype to multipart/form-data because the data will be split into multiple parts, one for each file plus one for the text data included in the form body
  - include one or more ```<input type="file>``` controls to allow your users to select the file(s) that will be uploaded

### Security Issues
- HTML forms are by far the most common places where attacks can occur
- Problems never come from the HTML forms themselves, they come from how the server handles data
- A few tips: escape potentially dangerous characters, limit the incoming amount of data to allow only what's necessary, sandbox uploaded files
