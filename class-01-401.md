## Array.map()

- Takes in an array (group of things - numbers, strings, etc) and iterates over the array one element at a time
- For each element, the array.map() function runs some sort of executable code (callback function) and returns a newly calculated value in a new array
- The new array returned will be the same length as the array that was input into the function
- Info on Array.map() from Code Fellows [overview](https://codefellows.github.io/code-301-guide/curriculum/class-07/challenges/) and [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/map)

## Array.reduce()

- Takes in an array and iterates over the array one element at a time
- For each element, the array.reduce() function runs some sort of executable code (callback function)
- Array.reduce() function has an accumulator value which is modified with each iteration
- The final output is the accumulator value after the last iteration
- You can set an initial value, which will be the value of the accumulator as it goes into the first iteration
- Info on Array.reduce() from Code Fellows [overview](https://codefellows.github.io/code-301-guide/curriculum/class-09/challenges/) and [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/Reduce)

## Superagent()

- Superagent is what we use to go out and get data from APIs
- Install superagent into your app: ```npm install superagent```
- At the top of your js file: ```const superagent = require('superagent');```

### Superagent() with normal Promise .then() syntax

```javascript

const url = `https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes?q=+intitle:keyword&maxResults=10`;
superagent.get(url)
  .then(results => {
    console.log(results.body);
  })
  .catch(error => console.log(error));

```

### Superagent() with async/await syntax

```javascript

async function getData(request, response){
  const results = await superagent.get('https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes?q=+intitle:keyword&maxResults=10')
}

getData().catch(error => console.log(error)));

```

## Promises

- A promise allows JavaScript to execute some code and then move on while it waits for results to come back
- Allows for that code to take as long as it needs to run
- Will run asynchronously and return data back to you at whatever point later on it gets it, out of the normal flow of the application
- Promises can either work or fail, called "resolve" or "reject"

## Are all callback functions considered to be Asynchronous?

- Not all callback functions are considered to be asynchronous
- For example, array methods like .map() or .reduce() are not asynchronous, they are completed right there inline and JavaScript does not move on until they are completed
- Callback functions can be asynchronous or synchronous depending on how they are used
- Synchronous will stay on the stack until complete
- Asynchronous will pop off the stack while running, and then back to the stack once completed
