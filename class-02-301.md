# Reading 2 - jQuery, Events, and the DOM

## jQuery (Duckett book)

### pg. 293-301

- Offers a simple way to achieve a variety of common JavaScript tasks quickly and consistently across all major browsers and without any fallback code needed
- jQuery is JS file that you include in your web pages, lets you find elements using CSS-style selectors an then do something with the elements using jQuery methods
- jQuery function:```$()```, has one parameter of CSS-style selector
- Similarities to DOM:
  - jQuery selectors perform similar task to traditional DOM queries, but syntax is simpler
  - You can store jQuery object in a variable
  - Can use jQuery methods and properties to manipulate the DOM nodes you select
- Differences from DOM:
  - It is cross-browser, no need to write fallback code
  - Selecting elements is simpler
  - Event handling is simpler as it uses one method that works in all major browsers
  - Methods effect all the selected elements without need to loop through each one
  - Additional methods are provided for popular required tasks such as animation
  - Once you have made a selection, you can apply multiple methods to it
- jQuery object has many methods that you can use to work with the elements you select, methods represent tasks that you commonly need to perform with elements

### pg. 306-331

- When you select one or more elements a jQuery object is returned, known as a matched set of a jquery selection
- Some jQuery methods retrieve information from and update the content of elements (```$('li').html();``` and ```$('li').html('Updated');``` for example)
- If a jQuery selection holds more than one element, and a method is used to update information on the page it will update all of the elements in the matched set
- Chaining: you can list several methods at a time in the same selector using dot notation
- jQuery's .ready() method checks that the page is ready for your coe to work with
- Retrieving element content:
  - ```.html()```: retrieves only the HTML inside the first element in the matched set
  - ```.text()```: returns the content from every element in the jQuery selection alsong with text from any descendants
- Updating elements:
  - ```.html()```: gives every element in matched set the same new content, may include HTML
  - ```.text()```: gives every element in matched set the same new text content
  - ```.replaceWith()```: replaces every element in matched set with new content
  - ```.remove()```: removes all of elements in matched set
- Inserting elements:
  - ```.before()```: inserts content before selected elements
  - ```.after()```: inserts content after selected elements
  - ```.prepend()```: inserts content inside the selected elements after the opening tag
  - ```.append()```: inserts content inside selected elements after closing tag
- Getting and setting attribute values:
  - ```.attr()```: get or set specified attribute and its value
  - ```.removeAttr()```: removes a specified attribute and its value
  - ```.addClass()```: adds a new value to the existing value of the class attribute
  - ```.removeClass()```: removes a value from class attribute, leaving other class names with that attribute intact
- Getting and setting CSS properties:
  - ```.css()``` lets you retrieve an set the value of CSS properties
  - Can set multiple properties using object literal notation
- Working with each element in a section:
  - ```.each()```: allows you to recreate the functionality of a loop on a section of elements
  - You can access the current element using the this keyword
- Event methods: ```.on()``` is used to handle all events
  - Has two optional parameters that let you filter initial jQuery selection to respond to subset of elements and pass extra information into the event handler using object literal notation

### pg. 354-357

- Ways to include jQuery in your page: hosting jQuery file with rest of website, or use a version hosted both other companies
- Position of ```<script>``` elements can effect how quickly a web page loads
- Best position is before the closing ```</body>``` tag, as it will not affect the rendering of the rest of the page, and the DOM has already loaded by the time the script is executed

## 6 Reasons for Pair Programming
1. Greater efficiency: easier to catch mistakes when two people are focusing on same code together
1. Engaged collaboration: more engaging than working alone, harder to procrastinate and get off task
1. Learning from fellow students: everyone has a different approach, working with a teammate can show you a different type of solution than you might have thought of yourself
1. Social skills: communcation is key, helps build skill of finding the right words
1. Job interview readiness: common step in many interview processes, great practice now
1. Work environment readiness: can hit the ground running at a new job being familiar with this
