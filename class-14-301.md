# Reading 14 - Database Normalization

## Introduction
- Database normalization is a process used to organize a database into tables and columns
- Table should be about a specific topic and only supporting topics included

## Reasons for Database Normalization
- Three main reasons: 
  - minimize duplicate data
  - minimize or avoid data modification issues
  - simplify queries

## Data Duplication and Modification Anomalies
- Duplicated information presents two problems:
  - increases storage and decreases performance
  - becomes more difficult to maintain data changes
- Modification anomalies that can occur:
  - insert
  - update: if don't update all rows, inconsistencies can appear
  - deletion

## Definition of Database Normalization
- Three common forms of database normalization: 1st, 2nd, 3rd normal form (1NF, 2NF, 3NF respectively)
- First normal form: information stored in a relational table with each column containing atomic values, no repeating groups of columns
- Second normal form: table is in first form and all the columns depend on the table's primary key
- Third normal form: table is in second normal form and all of its columns are not transitively dependent on the primary key
