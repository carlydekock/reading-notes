- Equality in distribution of conversational turn-taking.
- High average social sensitivity - skilled at intuiting how others felt based on their tone of voice, expressions, and other nonverbal cues.
- Psychological safety: sense of confidence that the team will not embarrass, reject or punish someone for speaking up.
- Team climate characterized by interpersonal trust and mutual respect in which people are comfortable being themselves.
- The behaviors that create psychological safety - conversational turn-taking and empathy - are part of the same unwritten rules we often turn to, as individuals, when we need to establish a bond.
