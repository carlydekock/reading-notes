# Reading 8 - SQL

## What is SQL?
- Structured Query Language
- Language designed to allow both technical and non-technical users query, manipulate, and transform data from a relational database
- Due to its simplicity, SQL databases provide safe and scalable storage for millions of websites and mobile applications

## Relational Databases
- Relational database: represents a collection of related (two-dimensional) tables
- Each of the tables are similar to an Excel spreadsheet, with a fixed nmber of named columns (attributes or properties of the table) and any number of rows of data

## SQL Lessons Notes
- To retrieve data from SQL database: SELECT statements, often referred to as queries
- Query is just a statement which declares what data we are looking for, where to find it in the database, and how to transform it before it is returned
- Can use * to select all
- Select multiple columns by using a , in between
- Can use a where clause in the query to filter certain results
- More complex clauses can be constructed by joining numerous AND or OR logical keywords
- Other operators: =, !=, <, <=, >, >=, BETWEEN...AND, NOT BETWEEN...AND, IN(...), NOT IN (...)
- Text-data specific operators: =, != or <>, LIKE, NOT LIKE, %, -, IN(...), NOT IN (...)
- DISTINCT: provides a way to discard rows that have a duplicate column value
- Can sort results by a given column in ascending or descending order using ORDER BY clause
- LIMIT (reduce number of rows to return) and OFFSET (specify where to begin counting the number rows from) used with ORDER 
- Database schema: what describes the structure of each table, and the datatypes that each column of the table can contain
- INSERT to insert new data into the database
- UPDATE to update existing data
- DELETE to delete data from a table in the database, along with WHERE clause
- CREATE TABLE to create new database table
- ALTER TABLE to add, remove, or modify columns and table constraints
- DROP TABLE to remove entire table, differs from delete in that it also removes the table schema from the database entirely
