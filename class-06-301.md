# Reading 6 - Node, Express, and APIs

## What is Node.js?
- A JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine
- V8 engine is the open-source JavaScript engine that runs in Google Chrome and other Chromium-based web browsers
- Creator of Node took the V8 engine and enhanced it with various features, such as a file system API, an HTTP library, and a number of operating system-related utility methods
- This means that Node.js is a program we can use to execute JavaScript on our computers, in other words, its a JavaScript runtime

## JavaScript package manager - npm
- npm is a package manager that comes bundled with Node
- npm is also the world's largest software registry
- Version manager: allows you to install multiple versions of Node and switch between them at will
- Using npm to install a package:
  - ```npm install -g jshint``` will install the jshint package globally on your system
  - Can also install locally to a project: ```npm install lodash --save``` to install lodash package locally and sve it as a project dependency
- The node_modules folder is where npm saved lodash (from example above) and any libraries that it depends on
- If you open the package.json file you'll see lodash listed under the dependencies field
- By specifying project dependencies in this way, you allow any developer anywhere to clone your project and use npm to install whatever package it needs to run

## What is Node.js used for?
- Build tools designed to automate the process of developing a modern JavaScript application
- Can be used for anything from bundling your JavaScript files and dependencies into static assets, to running test, or automatic code linting and style checking
- Node.js lets us run JavaScript on the server
- Node.js is single-threaded, and event-driven, which means that everything that happens in Node is in reaction to an event
- Node uses the libuv library to implement this asynchronous (non-blocking) behavior
- Node's execution model causes the server very little overhead, and consequently it's capable of handling a large number of simultaneous connections
- The traditional approach to scaling a Node app is to clone it and have the cloned instances share the workload
- Node even has a built-in module to help you implement a cloning strategy on a single server
- Node ca be used as a scripting language to automate repetitive or error prone tasks
- Can be used to build cross-platform desktop apps

## What kind of apps is Node.js suited to?
- Building applications that require some form of real-time interaction or collaboration
- Building APIs where you're handling lots of requests that are I/O driven
- Sites involving data streaming, Node makes it possible to process files while they're still being uploaded
- Node is fairly bare-bones, and the way you build and structure the app is left very much up to you
- Various frameworks that you can use, Express is a top option

## Downsides of Node.js
- The fact that Node runs in a single thread does result in some limitations (blocking I/O class should be avoided, CPU-intensive operations should be handed off to a worker thread, and errors should always be handled correctly for fear of crashing the process)
- Some also dislike the callback-based style of coding that JavaScript imposes

## Advantages of Node.js
- You can do everything in the same langugage (can easily share code between the server and the client)
- Node speaks JSON, which is probably the most important data exchange format on the web, and important for interacting with object databases (MongoDB)
- When working with Node, data can flow neatly between layers without the need for reformatting, you can have one syntax from browser to server to database
