# HTML Links, CSS Layout, JS Functions

## Links (HTML book, pg. 74-93)
- Types of links:
  - Links from one page to another
  - Links from one page to another on the same website
  - Links from one part of website to another part on same page
  - Links that open in new browser (```target```)
  - Links that start email program and address a new email to someone (```mailto:```)
- Writing links: 
  - Use the ```<a>``` element, specify which page you want to link using ```href``` attribute
  - Ex: ```<a href ="http://www.linkhere.com">Link to display</a>```
- Absolute URL: link to a different website
- Relative URL: linking to other pages within the same site
- Directory structure: organize your code by placing the pages for each different section of the site into a new folder

## Layout (HTML book, pg. 358-404)
- Key concepts in positioning elements:
  - block-level elements start on new line
  - in-line elements flow between surrounding text
  - containing elements: one block-level element inside another block-level element
- Positioning Schemes in CSS:
  - normal-flow: every block level element on a new line (default behavior)
  - relative positioning: moves from normal position to top/right/bottom/left
  - absolute positioning: positions in relationships to containing element
  - fixed positioning: positions in relationship to browser window
  - floating elements: take out of normal flow, position to the rar left or right of containing box
  - z-index property allows you to control which box appears on top if overlap

## Functions, Methods and Objects (JS book, pg. 86-99)
- Functions: series of statements that perform a specific task
- Methods: created inside (and are part of) an object
- Objects: made up of properties and methods
- Built-in objects: browser comes with set of objects that act like a toolkit
- Local variables and global variables

### Function terminology
- Giving the function a name and then writing the statements needed to achieve it's task is function declaration
- Asking function to peform a task is calling the function
- Pieces of info passed to function are parameters
- When you write a function and expect it to provide an answer, the response is a return value
- Statements do not run until a function is called

## Pair Programming
- The Driver (typing) and the navigator (guiding, thinking about big picture)
- Accomplishes four main fundamental skills: listening, speaking, reading, and writing
- Pair programming offers:
  - greater efficiency
  - engaged collaboration
  - learning from fellow students
  - social skills
  - job interview readiness
  - work environment readiness
