## EJS Partials

- Partials come in handy when you want to reuse the same HTML across multiple views
- Think of partials as functions, they make large websites easier to maintain as you don't have to go and change a piece of text in every page it appears in
- Navigation bar and footer that appear on every page make them good candidates for partials
- Create a partials folder: views/partials
- Can have specific files: views/partials/navbar.ejs (contains only the HTML for the navigation bar) and views/partials/footer.ejs (contains only the HTML for the footer)
- To include partial in EJS: use <%- include(PARTIAL_FILE) %> where the partial file is the relative to the template you use it in
- The <%-%> tags allow you to output the unescaped content onto the page (notice the -)
- This is important when using the include() statement since you don't want EJS to escape your HTML characters
