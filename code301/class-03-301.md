# Reading 3 - Flexbox and Templating

## Templating with Mustache

- JavaScript templating is a fast and efficient technique to render client-side view templates with JavaScript using a JSON data source
- Template is HTML markup, with added templating tags that will insert variables or run programming logic
- Template engine then replaces variables and instances declared in a template file with actual values at runtime, and convert the template into an HTML file sent to the client
- Moustache: a logic-less template syntax, works by expanding tags in a template using values provided in a hash or object
- Logic-less because there are no if statements, else clauses, or for loops, instead there are only tags
- mustache.js is implementation of the mustache template system in JavaScript
- Mustace is not a templating engine, but a specification for a templating language
- If you use mustache with Node and Express, you can use mustache-express

## Guide to Flexbox

- Parent element (flex container)
- Child element (flex items)

### Properties for parent (flex container)

- display (inline or block)
- flex direction (row (default), row-reverse, column, column-reverse)
- flex-wrap (nowrap (default), wrap, wrap-reverse)
- flex-flow (shorthand for flex-direction and flex-wrap, default is row nonwrap)
- justify-content (flex-start, flex-end, start, end, left, right, center, space-between, space-around, space-evenly)
- align-items (stretch (default), flex-start/start/self-start, flex-end/end/self-end, center, baseline)
- align-content (normal (default), flex-start/start, flex-end/end, center, space-between, space-around, space-evenly, stretch)

### Properties for child (flex items)

- order: controls the order in which they appear in the flex container
- flex-grow: defines the ability for a flex item to grow if necessary
- flex-shrink: defines the ability for a flex item to shrink if necessary
- flex-basis: defines the default size of an element before the remaining space is distributed
- flex: shorthand for flex-grow, flex-shrink, and flex-basis combined
- align-self: allows for default alignment to be overridden for individual flex items
