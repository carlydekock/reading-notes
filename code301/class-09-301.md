# Reading 9 - Refactoring

## Functional Programming Concepts

- Functional programming is a programming paradigm - a style of building the structure and elements of computer programs - that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing-state and mutable data
- Pure function: returns the same result if given the same arguments (also referred to as deterministic), and does not cause any observable side effects
  - If a function reads external files it is not a pure function, the file's contents can change
  - Any function that relies on random number generator cannot be pure
  - Pure funtions are stable, consistent, and predictable
- Immutability: unchanging over time or unable to be changed
  - If you want to change an immutable object, you can't, you create a new object with a new value
- Referential transparency: if function consistently yields the same result for the same input (pure functions + immutable data = referential transparency)
- Functions as first class entities: refer to it from constants and variables, pass it as a parameter to other functions, return as a result from other functions
- Higher order functions: a function that either takes one or more functions as arguments or returns a function as its result
- Filter: filter function expects true or false value to determine if the element should or should not be included in the result collection (if the callback expression is true, the filter function will include the element in the result collection, otherwise it will not)
- Map: map method transforms a collection by applying the function to all of its elements and building a new collection from the returned values
- Reduce: receive a function and a collection, and return a value created by combining the items

## Refactoring JavaScript for Readability - Strategies

- Return early from functions
- Cache variables so functions can be read like sentences
- Check for web APIs before implementing your own functionality
