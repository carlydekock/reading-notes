## Regex
- Regular expressions (regex or regexp) are useful for extracting information from any text
- Do this by searching for one or more matches of a specific search pattern
- Application ranges from validation to parsing/replacing strings, passing through translating data to other formats and web scraping
- Anchors: ^ and $
- Quantifiers: * + ? and {}
- OR operator | or ```[]```
- Character classes: \d \w \s and .
- Flags: global (g), multi-line (m), insensitive (i)
- Grouping and capturing: ```()```
- Bracket expressions: ```[]```
- Greedy and lazy match: * + {} are greedy operators, can use ? to make it lazy
- Boundaries: -\b and \B
- Back references: \1
- Look ahead and look behind: ```(?=)``` and ```(?<=)```
