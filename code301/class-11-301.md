# Reading 11 - EJS

## Intro to EJS - Overview
- EJS is a templating language that lets you generate HTML markup with plain JavaScript

## Intro to EJS - Getting Started
- ```npm init```
- ```npm install --S express body-parser cors ejs```
- Setup in server.js:
  - ```const express = require('express');```
  - ```const bodyParser = require('body-parser');```
  - ```const cors  require('cors');```
  - ```const path = require('path');``` takes two paths and joins them
  - ```const app = express();```
  - ```app.use(bodyParser());```
  - ```app.use(cors());```
  - ```app.set('views', path.join(_dirname, 'views'));```
  - ```app.set('view engine', 'ejs');```
- Create new folder views, and a file index.ejs
  - ```app.get(...) {response.render('index')});```
  - ```app.listen(...)```

## Intro to EJS - Injecting values into the views
- Taking route and going to render index.ejs
- Response.render takes three parameters (string of file name, local variables, callback)
- Opening and closing EJS tags: <%...%>
- The = sign says going to evaluate a variable for you (like the {{}} in Handlebars or Angular)
- Can put them in line, can put inside an image tag
- Common use case: may have some sort of API call, or delete call where don't need to pass any data (```"/<%foo.id %>/destroy"```)
- You can pass anything in that you want

## Intro to EJS - For Loops and Arrays
- In index.ejs going to create the list to input an array of people:

``` JavaScript
<ul>
<% for(var person of people) { %>
  <li><%= person.name %></li>
  <% } %>
</ul>
```

## Intro to EJS - If/Else Statement
- In index.ejs going to create the if/else statement for people
- If name is dave, this is definitely dave
``` JavaScript
<ul>
  <% for(var person of people) { %>
    <% if(person.name === 'dave') { %>
    <li>This is definitely <%= person.name %>!!!</li>
    <% } else { %>
    <li>This is definitely not dave!!! This is <%= person.name %></li>
    <% } %>
  <% } %>
</ul>
```

## Intro to EJS - Partials
- Partials are native to EJS
- Use case: a nav bar or a footer, some re-usable piece of text that stays static
- ```<%- include('partials/onepartial') %>``` will look in directory partials, for ejs file called onepartial

## Intro to EJS - Layouts
- Layouts are not native to EJS, but can be really useful
- Create another file views/about.ejs
- Create a file called views/layout.ejs
- Have to install layouts: ```npm install --save express-ejs-layouts```
- In server.js file: going to add ```const expressLayouts = require('express-ejs-layouts');```
- In server.js file: going to add ```app.use(expressLayouts);```
- Layout file is the wrapper - will take everything we want to put in there
- Will be an ejs tag with - that says body: ```<%- body %>```

## Google Books APIs - Volumes
- Can perform a volumes search by sending an HTTP GET request to the following URL: ```https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes?q=search+terms```
- Request has a single required parameter: q - searches for volumes that contain this text string
- Special keywords that you can specify in the search terms to search in particular fields such as:
  - intitle
  - inauthor
  - inpublisher
  - subject
  - isbn
  - lccn
  - oclc
- If request succeeds, server reponds with a 200 OK HTTP status code and the volume result
- Optional query parameters:
  - download format
  - filtering (partial, full, free-ebooks, paid-ebooks, ebooks)
  - pagination (startIndex, maxResults)
  - print type (all, books, magazines)
  - projection (full, lite)
  - sorting (relevance, newest)
- Retrieving a specific volume: can send an HTTP GET request to the volume resource URI
- Working with bookshelves
  - retrieving list of a user's public bookshelves
  - retrieving a list of volumes on a public bookshelf
- Working with bookshelves in "My Library"
  - retrieving a list of my bookshelves - HTTP GET
  - retrieving a list of volumes on my bookshelf - HTTP GET
  - adding a volume to my bookshelf - HTTP POST
  - removing a volume from my bookshelf - HTTP POST
  - clearing all volumes from my bookshelf - HTTP POST
- Query parameter reference: [Google Books APIs - Working Volumes](https://developers.google.com/books/docs/v1/using#WorkingVolumes)

## EJS Docs
- EJS docs reference [here](https://ejs.co/)
- EJS is templating language that lets you generate HTMl markup with plain JavaScript
- Benefits: use plain JavaScript, fast development time, simple syntax, speedy execution, easy debugging, active development
- Get started: npm install ejs
- To use it, pass EJS a template string and some data:

```JavaScript
let ejs = require('ejs');
let people = ['geddy', 'neil', 'alex'];
let html = ejs.render('<%= people.join(", "); %>', {people: people});
```

- Tag examples:
  - <% for control-flow, no output
  - <%= outputs the value into the template
  - <%- outputs the unescaped value into the template
