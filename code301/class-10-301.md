# Reading 10 - The Call Stack

## Call Stack Defined

- Call stack: mechanism for an interpreter to keep track of its place in a script that calls multiple functions, what function is currently being run and what functions are called from within that function
- When a script calls a function, the interpreter adds it to the call stack and then starts carrying out the function
- Any functions that are called by that function are added to the call stack and resumes exection where it left off in the last code listing
- If the stack takes up more spae than it had assigned to, it results in "stack overflow" error

## Understanding the JavaScript call stack

- At most basic level, the call stack is a data structure that uses the last in first out (LIFO) principle to temporarily store and manage function invocation (call)
- The JavaScript engine (found in a hosting environment like the browser) is a single-threaded interpreter comprising of a heap and a single call stack
- Call stack is primarily used for function invocation (call)
- Since the call stack is single, function(s) execution is done, one at a time, from top to bottom, which means the call stack is synchronous
- In Asynchronous JavaScript, we have a callback function, an event loop, and a task queue
- Callback function is acted upon by the call stack during execution after the call back function has been pushed to the stack by the event loop
- Stack overflow occurs when there is a recursive function (function that calls itself) without an exit point
- The browser (hosting environment) has a maximum call stack that it can accomodate before throwing a stack error
- Key takeaways:
  - Call stack is single threaded, it can only do one thing at a time
  - Code exectution is synchronous
  - A function invocation creates a stack frame that occupies a temporary memory
  - It works as a LIFO- last in first out data structure

## JavaScript error messages

- Types of errors:
  - Reference errors: trying to use a variable that is not yet declared
  - Syntax errors: have something that cannot be parsed in terms of syntax
  - Range errors: trying to manipulate an object with some kind of length and give it an invald length
  - Type errors: types (number, string, etc) you are trying to use or access are incompatible
