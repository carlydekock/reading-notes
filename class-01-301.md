# Reading 1 - SMACSS and Responsive Web Design

## Shay Howe's Intro to RWD

- Responsive Web Design (RWD): building a website suitable to work on every device and every screen size, no matter how large or small, mobile or desktop
- Responsive vs adaptive vs mobile
  - Responsive: react quickly and positively to any change (websites continually and fluidly change based on different factors such as viewport width)
  - Adaptive: easily modified for a new purpose or situation (built on preset factors)
  - Mobile: generally means build a separate website commonly on a new domain solely for mobile users
- RWD main components:
  1. Flexible layouts
  2. Media queries
  3. Flexible media

### Flexible Layouts

- Practice of building the layout of a website with a flexible grid, capable of dynamically resizing to any width
- Flexible grids are built using relative length units, most commonly % or em units
- Relative lengths are then used to declare property values such as width, margin, padding
- CSS3 introduced new relative length units related to viewport size of the browser or device:
  - vw: viewports width
  - vh: viewports height
  - vmin: min of viewports height and width
  - vmax: max of viewports height and width
- There is a formula to identify properties of flexible layout using relative units, based on taking the target width of element and dividing by the width of the parent element, result is the width of the target element: target/context = result

### Media Queries

- Built as an extension to media types commonly found when targeting and including styles
- Provide the ability to specify different styles for individual browser and device circumstances
- Initializing media queries: recommended to use the ```@media``` rule inside existing style sheet
- Each media query may include:
  - Media type: all, screen, print, tv, and braille
  - Expression: may include different media features and values, which then allocate to be true or false
- Logical operators for media queries: and, not, only
- Media features: identify what attributes or properties will be targeted within the media query expression
  - ```height``` and ```width```: based off the height and width of the viewport rendering area or browser window for example, can be prefixed with min or max
    - With responsive design, most commonly used are ```min-width``` and ```max-width```
  - ```orientation```: determines if a device is in landscape or portrait orientation (this plays large part with mobile devices)
  - ```aspect-ratio``` and ```device-aspect-ratio```: specifies the width/height pixel ratio of targeted rendering area or output device
    - value of this consists of two positive integers separated by forward slash, first is width in pixels, second is height in pixels
    - ```pixel-ratio``` and ```device-pixel-ratio``` are great for identifying high definition devices
  - ```resolution```: specifies the resolution of output device in pixel density (dots per inch or DPI)
  - ```color```, ```color-index```, and ```monochrome```: identify output colors
  - ```grid```: identify bitmap devices
  - ```scan```: scanning process of television

### Mobile First

- Mobile first approach includes using styles targeted at smaller viewports as the default style, then use media queries to add styles as viewport grows

### Viewport

- Apple invented the ```viewport``` meta tag to help in identifying the viewport size, scale, and resolution of a website
- ```height``` and ```width``` will define the height and width respectively, each accepts either postiive integer or keyword (device-height and device-width)
- To control how a website is scaled on a mobile device use ```minimum-scale```, ```initial-scale```, and ```user-scalable``` properties
  - ```initial-scale``` should be set to 1 as this defines the ratio between device height in portrait mode and viewport size (ratio of device width and viewport size in landscape mode)
  - ```initial-scale``` values should always be a positive integer between 0 and 10
  - ```minimum-scale``` and ```maximum-scale``` values determine how small and large a viewport may be scaled
  - ```minimum-scale``` value should be positive integer lower than or equal to ```initial-scale```
  - ```maximum-scale``` value should be positive integer greater than or equal to ```initial-scale```
  - Values should not be set to the same as the ```initial-scale``` generally, as it would disable any zooming
  - Zooming can be accomplished by using ```user-scalable``` value (no disables zooming, yes allows zooming)
- Letting browser decide how to scale a website based off any viewport scale values is usually fine
- If more control needed, use the ```target-densitydpi``` value (device-dpi, high-dpi, medium-dpi, low-dpi or actual DPI number)
- It is recommended to move the viewport from meta tag with HTML to an @ rule within CSS

### Flexible Media

- Images, vides, and other media types need to be scalable, changing size as the size of the viewport changes
- Quick way to make media scalable is by using the ```max-width``` property with value of 100%
- ```max-width``` doesn't work well for all instances of media such as iframes and embedded media
- To get embedded media to be fully responsive:
  - embedded element needs to be absolutely positined within parent element
  - parent element needs to have width of 100% so it may scale based on width of viewport
  - parent element needs to have height of 0 to trigger the ```hasLayout``` mechanism (within Internet Explorer)
  - padding is then given to the bottom of the parent element

## All About Floats

- Float is a CSS positioning property with origins from the print design world
- Floated elements remain a part of the flow of the web page (distinctly different than page elements that use absolute positioning)
- Four valid values for the ```float``` property: left and right, none (the default), inherit (assumes float value from parent element)
- ```clear``` property: element that has clear property set will not move up adjacent to the float like the float desires, but will move itself down past the float
- Four values for ```clear``` property: both, left, right, none
- Keep in mind how floats can effect their parent elements, can cause collapsing
- Can fix collapsing by clearing the float afer the floated elements in the container but before the close of the container
- Techniques for clearing floats:
  - ```clear: both;``` in a situation where you always know what succeeding element is going to be, this is ideal
  - Empty div method
  - Overflow method: relies on resetting the overflow CSS property on a parent element
  - Easy clearing method: uses a clever CSS psudo selector (```:after```) to clear floats
- Problems with floats:
  - Pushdown: symptom of an element inside a floated item being wider than the float itself (typically an image), can use ```overflow: hidden``` to cut off excess
  - Double margin bug: if you apply margin in same direction as float it may double the margin, set ```display: inline``` on the float
  - The 3px job: text that is next to floated element is kicked away by 3px, set a width or height on the affected text
  - Bottom margin bug: when a floated parent has floated children inside it the bottom margin on those children is ignored by the parent, can use bottom padding on the parent instead

## Don't Overthink It Grids

- Context: block level element is as wide as the parent (width: auto;)
- Columns: make column divs with appropriate class names, float them, and apply specific widths (66.66% and 33.33% for example)
- Clearing context: parent element collapsing to zero height since it only has floated children, can fix it by clearing it (clear: both)
- Gutters: hardest part about grids, think about doing fixed pixel sized gutters
  - First step: use ```box-sizing: border-box```
  - Second step: apply fixed padding
- Outside gutters: consider using an opt-in class for this
  - First step: add left padding to the grid parent (optionally top and bottom padding)
  - Second step: restore the right padding to the last column
- More column choices: can set to whatever you'd like, just make sure column fractions add to 1

### Floats and Riding Escalators

- Floats create alternate flows
- Once you introduce them, you need to write your code so that it accounts for up to three flows: normal, left, and right
- Float property gives an indication of an element's relationship to surrounding elements
- Clear allows elements to specify where they should align in comparison to the floated elements

## SMACSS Official Documentation

- Scalable and Modular Architecture for CSS (pronounced "smacks")
- More of a style guide than rigid framework
- SMACSS is a consistent approach to site development when using CSS
- Five types of categories:
  1. Base
  1. Layout
  1. Module
  1. State
  1. Theme

### Base

- Base rules are the defaults
- Mostly single element selectors but it could include attribute selectors, pseudo-class selectors, child selectors or sibling selectors
- Base style says wherever element is on the page it should look like what is specified
  
### Layout

- Layout rules divide the page into sections
- Layouts hold one or more modules together
  
### Modules

- Reusable modular parts of design
- Callouts, sidebar sections, lists, etc
- Each module should be designed to exist as a standalone component
- Avoid using IDs and element selectors, sticking only to class names
  
### State

- Ways to describe how modules or layouts will look when in a particular state
- Can describe how a module might look in different views like the home page or inside page
- State styles can apply to layout and/or module styles
- State styles indicate a JavaScript dependency
- State styles are appied to elements to indicate a change in state while the page is still running
- States should be made to stand alone and are usually built of a single class selector

### Theme

- Similar to state rules in that they describe how modules or layouts might look
- Most sites don't require a layer of theme but its good to be aware of
- Separating the theme out into its own set of styles allows for those styles to be easily redefined for alternate themes
