# Reading 5 - Heroku Deployment

## Heroku
- Heroku: cloud application platform to turn a local server into a world wide server
- Using Node.js: an open source, cross platform runtime environment which allows you to build server-side and networking applications
- From your repository in terminal, use ```heroku create``` to create the Heroku application
- Heroku generates a random number for and url for the application
- Every Heroku app starts with no branches and no code
- First time we deploy the project, specify a remote branch to push to ```git push heroku main```
- Now that the application is deployed, ensure that at least one instance of the app is running: ```heroku ps:scale web=1```
- If you want to change the name, use ```heroku apps:rename chosennamehere```
- Now you can open the Heroku project in your web browser using: ```heroku open```
- Node.js is reffered to by the acronym DIRT (data intensive real time applications). Node allows a server to handle a lot of connections and work with a number of requests at the same time.
