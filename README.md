## About Me
I'm Carly. I'm just learning to code through Code Fellows and am looking forward to the journey! You can see my GitHub page [here](https://github.com/carlydekock). I previously worked as a Recruiter, but wanted to try something new and learn to code in search of a potential career change. In my spare time I enjoy skiing, surfing, mountain biking and gardening.
