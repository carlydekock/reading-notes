# Class 31 - Hooks API

## Review, Research, and Discussion

1. **Why do we not need more .html pages in a multi-page React app?** Do not need them thanks to client-side routing libraries, react-router-dom allows to register multiple URLs and their corresponding components in one of the parent nodes of the DOM tree. Then, depending on the URL entered certain nodes are rendered to the DOM and others are not. Single-page-applications still need to get data for different components as components render. They may smaller requests for only the data (typically JSON) that is needed whereas a traditional website would request the entire HTML document again as well as the data. In React, data fetching is done inside of components with functions like ```componentDidMount``` or using React hooks. (source: [RapidAPI](https://rapidapi.com/blog/react-multi-page-app/))
1. **If we wanted a component to show up on every page, where would we put it and why?** Inside the ```<BrowserRouter />```, outside a ```<Route />``` -> this will allow it to render on all pages regardless of a specified route. Although from this [article](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-handle-routing-in-react-apps-with-react-router) it also looks like putting it outside of the ```<BrowserRouter />``` all together might work as well to render to every page, if it is setup properly.
1. **What does props.children contain?** Props.children is a special prop, automatically passed to every component that can be used to render the content included between the opening and closing tags when invoking a component. Content passed through props.children can include undefined, null, boolean, a number, a string, a React element or an array of any of these recursively, it can also be a function returning one of these types.

## Terminology

- **Composition**: the act of combining parts or elements to form a whole, components are the UI building blocks in React applications like pure functions are the building blocks of function composition. (source: [Medium](https://medium.com/leanjs/react-is-all-about-composition-f9f49dec183c))
- **Children/Child Components**: components that are nested within a parent React component (button within a form for example), within the parent components JSX tags [React docs](https://reactjs.org/docs/composition-vs-inheritance.html)
- **Hash Routing**: Using the anchor part of the URL to simulate different content, for example http://example.com/#/products will lead to displaying a list of products but the #/products will not be sent to the server it is completely operating on the client-side. This routing is possible because changes in the hash don't trigger page reload. (source: Krasimir JS [blog](https://krasimirtsonev.com/blog/article/deep-dive-into-client-side-routing-navigo-pushstate-hash)) notes on ```<HashRouter>``` in React [here](https://reactrouter.com/web/api/HashRouter)
- **Link Routing**: Provides declarative, accessible navigation around the application (source: React [docs](https://reactrouter.com/web/api/Link))
