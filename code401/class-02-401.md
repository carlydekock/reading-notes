# Reading 2 - Express

## Review, Research, and Discussion

### Difference between PUT and PATCH
- Doing a similar thing of updating a resource at a location, but each go about it differently
- Info from RapidAPI article [here](https://rapidapi.com/blog/put-vs-patch/)
- Another article explaining the differences from Medium [here](https://medium.com/backticks-tildes/restful-api-design-put-vs-patch-4a061aa3ed0b)

#### PUT
- PUT is a method of modifying resource where the client sends data that updates the entire resource
- Overwrites if exists and creates a new resource if it doesn't already exist
- Viewed as the modified version of the resource saved on the original server and client is requesting to replace it

#### PATCH
- PATCH applies a partial update to the resource
- Only need to send the data you want to update, it won't affect or change anything else
- Viewed as a set of instructions that describe how a resource stored on the original server should be martially modified to create a new version

### Services and tools that allow you to "mock" an API for development
- [Postman](https://www.postman.com/)
- [Stoplight](https://stoplight.io/)
- [Beeceptor](https://beeceptor.com/)

### Compare and Contrast: Swagger and APIDocs.js
- Both are tools to create documentation for your API
- Swagger is set of open-source tools built around the OpenAPI specification (API description format for REST APIs) that can help you design, build, document, and consume REST APIs
- apiDoc creates documentation from annotations in your source code
- Swagger docs [here](https://swagger.io/)
- apiDoc docs [here](https://apidocjs.com/)

#### Which HTTP status codes should be sent with each type of (un)successful API call?
- Info from MDN [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status)
  - Informational responses (100-199)
  - Successful responses (200-299)
  - Redirects (300-399)
  - Client errors (400-499)
  - Server errors (500-599)

### Compare and Contrast: SOAP and REST
- SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol) is a standards-based web service communication protocol, relies exclusively on XML to provide messaging services
- REST (Representational State Transfer) is another standard, made in response to the shortcomings of SOAP, and to create a simpler method of accessing web services
- REST is most commonly used when exposing a public API over the internet while SOAP exposes components of application logic as services rather than data
- REST accesses data while SOAP performs operations through more rigid set of messaging 
- Benefits of REST over SOAP: uses HTTP for simplicity, allows greater variety of data formats, generally faster and uses less bandwidth
- Benefits of SOAP over REST: if you need more security, offers built-in retry logic for failed communications, highly extensible through other protocols and technologies
- Comparisons of REST versus SOAP from [SmartBear](https://smartbear.com/blog/soap-vs-rest-whats-the-difference/) and [Stackify](https://stackify.com/soap-vs-rest/)

## Vocabulary Terms
- Web server: server software or a system of one or more computers dedicated to running this softare, that can satsify client HTTP requests on the World Wide Web or on private networks (definition from Wikipedia)
  - Additional info on web servers from [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Common_questions/What_is_a_web_server)
- Express: Minimal and flexible Node.js back end web application framework that provides a robust set of features for web and mobile applications (from Express [docs](https://expressjs.com/))
- Routing: process of selecting a path for traffic in a network or between or across multiple networks (definition from Wikipedia)
- WRRC: web request response cycle, details how information moves between client/server

## NodeJS and Express
- Node is open-source, cross-platform runtime environment that allows developers to create server-side tools and applications in JavaScript
- Express is the most popular Node web framework, and is the underlying library for a number of other popular Node web frameworks
- Express provides a means to:
  - Write handlers for requests with different HTTP verbs at different paths/routes
  - Integrate with view rendering engines in order to generate responses by inserting data into templates
  - Set common web app settings like port to use for connecting, location of templates that are used for rendering the response
  - Add additional request processing "middleware"
- Web frameworks are often opinionated (those with opinions about the "right way to handle a particular task) or unopinionated (far fewer restrictions on the best way to glue components together to get to goal, or even what components should be sued)
- Express is unopinionated - you have lots of choices, and its extremely flexible

## NPM
- npm is the world's largest software registry
- npm consists of three distinct components:
  - website (used to discover packages, set up profiles)
  - command line interface or CLI (runs from a terminal, how developers interact with npm)
  - registry (large public database of JS software and the meta-information surrounding it)

## TDD
- TDD stands for test-driven development
- Refers to a style of programming in which three activities are tightly interwoven: coding, testing (unit tests) and design (refactoring)
- Can be described by this set of rules:
  - Write a single unit test describing an aspect of the program
  - Run the test, which should fail because the program lacks that feature
  - Write just enough code, the simplest possible, to make the test pass
  - Refactor the code until it conforms to the simplicity criteria
  - Repeat, accumulating unit tests over time

## CI/CD
- Continuous Integration/Continous Delivery
- Continuous Integration(CI) ensures everyone's changes integrate with current version of project, catch bugs, and reduce merge conflicts
- Continuous Delivery (CD) is the practice of developing software in such a way that you could release at any time
- Continuous deployment is extension of continous delivery, process that allows you to deploy newly developed features into production
