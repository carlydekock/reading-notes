# Reading 16 - AWS Cloud Servers

## Review, Research, and Discussion

1. **Whatâ€™s the difference between a FIFO and a standard queue?** FIFO queues have essentially the same features as standard queues, but provide the added benefits of supporting ordering and exactly-once processing and ensure the order in which messages are sent and received is strictly preserved (source: [Medium](https://medium.com/awesome-cloud/aws-difference-between-sqs-standard-and-fifo-first-in-first-out-queues-28d1ea5e153))
1. **How can the server be assured a message was properly received?** By having the client emit a "received" event back to the server upon receipt of the message
1. **What classic design pattern is best represented by event driven programming?** Observer design pattern, an object (subject) maintains a list of its dependents (observers) and notifies them automatically of any state changes usually by calling one of their methods (source: [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observer_pattern))
1. **How do you test an event driven system?** With unit tests which test individual components of the system, as well as tests for verifying the server and clients are communicating back and forth

## Vocabulary Terms

- Server: piece of computer hardware or software that provides functionality for other programs or devices called clients (source: Wikipedia)
- Pub/Sub: asynchronous messaging service that decouples sevices that produce events from services that process events (source: Google Cloud [docs](https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/docs/overview))
- WRRC: Web request response cycle

## AWS EC2

- Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) is a web service that provides secure, resizable computer capacity in the cloud
- Designed to make web-scale cloud computing easier for developers
- Allows you to obtain and configure capacity with minimal friction
- Provides you with complete control of your computing resources and lets you run on Amazon's proven computing environment
- EC2 offers the broadest and the deepest compute platform with choice of processor, storage, networking, operating system, and purchase model
- SLA commitment of 99.99% availability for each Amazon EC2 region, each region consists of at least 3 availability zones

## Videos

- Virtual machine manager: also called a hypervisor, type of software that allows us to run an operating system within another operating system (examples: virtualbox, vmware)
- AWS Elastic Beanstalk: easy to use service for deploying and scaling web applications and services developed with Java, .NET, PHP, Node.js, Python, Ruby and Docker
