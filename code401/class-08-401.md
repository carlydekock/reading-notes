# Reading 8 - Access Control (ACL)

## Review, Research, and Discussion

1. When is Basic Authorization used vs. Bearer Authorization? basic is string based while bearer is token based, bearer is more secure than basic since the tokens are encrypted
1. What does the JSON Web Token package do? allows you to create JWTs, compact and self-contained way for securely transmitting information between parties as a JSON object
1. What considerations should we make when creating and storing a SECRET? should be kept protected, best kept in an .env file that is not uploaded with the rest of your code

## Vocabulary Terms

- Encryption: attempting to hide information/data
- Token: used in bearer authentication, token is a cryptic string that is generated by the server in response to a login request
- Bearer: bearer authentication can be understood as "give access to the bearer of this token" (source: swagger [docs](https://swagger.io/docs/specification/authentication/bearer-authentication/))
- Secret: this is what is paired with token, a secret string stored on the server used to sign and encode the token
- JSON Web Token: consists of three parts separated by dots - header, payload, signature

## 5 steps to simple role-based access control (RBAC)

- RBAC is the idea of assigning system access to users based on their role in the organization
- Alternatives/variations of RBAC:
  - Access control lists (ACL): defining access rights by a given user or user group, to a specific object such as a document
  - Attribute-based access control (ABAC): sometimes known as policy-based access control, can use variety of attributes including user department, time of day, location of access, type of access required
- RBAC implementation:
  - Inventory your systems
  - Analyze your workforce and create roles
  - Assign people to roles
  - Never make one-off changes
  - Audit

## Role-based access control (Wikipedia)

- In computer systems security, role-based access control (RBAC) or role-based security is an approach to restricting system access to authorized users
- Can implement mandatory access control or disretionary access control
- Three primary rules are defined for RBAC:
  - Role assignment: A subject can exercise a permission only if the subject has selected or been assigned a role
  - Role authorization: A subject's active role must be authorized for the subject. With rule 1 above, this rule ensures that users can take on only roles for which they are authorized
  - Permission authorization: A subject can exercise a permission only if the permission is authorized for the subject's active role. With rules 1 and 2, this rule ensures that users can exercise only permissions for which they are authorized
