# Class 39 - Redux - Additional Topics

## Review, Research, and Discussion

1. **What’s the best practice for “pre-loading” data into the store (on application start) in a Redux application?** Can use a useEffect() hook to load data on application start.
1. **When using a thunk/async action that dispatches the actual action, which do you export from your reducer?** You export the actual action from the reducer.

## Vocabulary Terms

- **Middleware**: Code you put in between the framework receiving a request and the framework generating the response (source: [Redux docs](https://redux.js.org/understanding/history-and-design/middleware))
- **Thunk**: Function that wraps an expressio to delay its evaluation (source: [Redux thunk docs](https://github.com/reduxjs/redux-thunk))
