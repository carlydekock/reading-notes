# Reading 32 - Custom Hooks

## Review, Research, and Discussion

1. **What does a component’s lifecycle refer to?** Lifecycle of a component is series of methods that are invoked in different stages of the component's existence. Lifecycle methods give ways to interact with component logic before/during/after being used in the DOM. (source: [GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/reactjs-lifecycle-components/))
1. **Why do you sometimes need to “wrap” functions in ```useCallback``` when called from within ```useEffect```** ```useCallback()``` is often used in conjunction with ```useEffect()``` because it allows you to prevent the re-creation of a function. (source: [Medium](https://medium.com/@infinitypaul/reactjs-useeffect-usecallback-simplified-91e69fb0e7a3) and [React docs](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-reference.html))
1. **Why are functional components preferred over class components?** Functional components are much easier to read and test, they have less code, easier to separate container and presentational components.

## Vocabulary Terms

- **State hook**: ```useState()```, similar to ```this.setState()``` in a class except it doesn't merge the old and new state together. The only argument to ```useState()``` is the initial state. Allows us to add a state powered variable to our application. (source: [React docs](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-overview.html))
- **Effect hook**: ```useEffect()```, adds the ability to perform side effects (data fetching, subscriptions, or manually changing the DOM from React components) from a function component. Serves the same purpose as ```componentDidMount```, ```componentDidUpdate```, and ```componentWillUnmount``` in React classes but unified into a single API. Allows us to define properties that will trigger or not trigger React API features.
- **Reducer hook**: alternative to ```useState()```, accepts a reducer of type (state, action) => newState, and returns the current state paired with a dispatch method (method to dispatch actions and trigger state changes per [React Redux docs](https://react-redux.js.org/using-react-redux/connect-mapdispatch))
- Sources: React hooks [overview](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-overview.html) and [reference list](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-reference.html) and notes from CSS tricks on useReducer hook [here](https://css-tricks.com/getting-to-know-the-usereducer-react-hook/)
