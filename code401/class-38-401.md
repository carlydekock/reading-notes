# Class 38 - Redux - Asynchronous Actions

## Review, Research, and Discussion

1. **How granular should your reducers be?** It is difficult to manage states that are deeply nested, so more reducers is better than only a few. Redux gives us combineReducers to let us define more precisely what our initial state will look like.
1. **Pro or Con – multiple reducers can “fire” when a commonly named action is dispatched** Not sure, I would guess con as it gets messy and actions need to get filtered through. 
1. **Name a strategy for preventing the above** Using Redux middleware thunk, allows for evaluating the actions.

## Vocabulary Terms

- **Store**: Holds the whole state tree of the application, only way to change the state inside is to dispatch an action on it. (source: [Redux store docs](https://redux.js.org/api/store))
- **Combined Reducers**: Helper function turns an object whose values are different reducing functions into a single reducing function you can pass to createStore. (source: [Redux docs](https://redux.js.org/api/combinereducers))
