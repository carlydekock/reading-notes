# Reading 4 - Data Modeling

## Review, Research, and Discussion

1. **Name 3 advantages to Test Driven Development:** more modular design, easier to maintain, easier to refactor, high test coverage
1. **In what case would you need to use beforeEach() or afterEach() in a test suite?** When you have work you need to do repeatedly for many tests
1. **What is one downside of Test Driven Development:** slow process
1. **Whatâ€™s the primary difference between ES6 Classes and Constructor/Prototype Classes?** A class defines a type which can be instantiated at runtime, whereas a prototype is itself an object instance
1. **Why REST?**

- considered to be the standard for web APIs
- user-friendly and easy to understand for the developers coding on it
- since REST utilizes standard HTTP asks, data validation and address verification   APIs are simple for designers to comprehend and execute
- RESTful architectures make it simple to give output in more adaptable data formats like JSON

## Vocabulary Terms

- Functional programming: process of building software by composing pure functions, avoiding shared state, mutable data, and side-effects
- Object-oriented programming: programming paradigm which tries to emulate real world problems using the abstract concept of 'objects' as data structure which can be mutated and referenced
- Class: template for creating objects (per [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Classes))
- ```super```: used to call corresponding methods of super class (used in subclasses)
- ```this```: within a class constructor, this is a regular object, calling super() creates a ```this``` binding within the constructor
- Test Driven Development (TDD): software development process relying on software requirements being converted to test cases before software is fully developed, and tracking all software development by repeatedly testing the software against all test cases
- Jest: JavaScript testing framework (works with Babel, Typescript, Node, React, Angular, Vue)
- Continuous Integration (CI): automating the integration of code changes from multiple contributors into a single software project
- REST: Representational State Transfer, an architectural style for providing standards between computer systems on the web, making it easier for systems to communicate with each other
- Data Model: abstract model that organizes elements of data and standardizes how they relate to one another and to the properties of real-world entities

## NoSQL vs SQL

### NoSQL

- primarily called non-relational database
- document based, key-value pairs, graph databases, or wide-column stores
- dynamic schema for unstructured data
- horizonally scalable
- queries are focused on collection of documents, sometimes called unstructured query language (UnQL)

### SQL

- primarly called relational databases
- table databases
- predefined schema
- vertically scalable
- use structured query language

## NoSQL Modeling Techniques

- Often compared by various non-functional criteria, such as scalability, performance, and consistency
- Often starts from the application-specific queries as opposed to relational modeling
- Often requires a deeper understanding of data structures and algorithms than relational database modeling does
- Data duplication and denormalization are first class citizens
